# Machine-Multiple-Choice-QA
**COMP5423 Group Project**

## Project Requirements
Please read "COMP5423-Group-Project.pdf"

1. Conventional Feature-based
  * Based on traditional mathematics and statistical methods
3. Transformer Learning Bert-based
  * Only applying Bert Encoder to train the model
  * No Fine-Tuning
4. Bidirectional Encoder Representation with Transformer-based
  ‚≠êÔ∏è My responsible task
   * QA Dataset
    * MC Test
    * RACE
    * Dream
   * Differnet transformers are applied on different dataset
    * Depends on the dataset size and the type of the questions and answers
   * Involving Fine-Tuning

# Data File
1. MCTEST
2. RACE
3. DREAM

# Program File

   1. mctest_bert_large.ipynb
   2. mctest_albert.ipynb
   3. race_distilbert.ipynb
   4. race_albert.ipynb
   5. dream_albert.ipynb

## Installation
1. Go to Google Colab and upload the program file that you would like to run on it.

1. Drag and drop datasets to Colab and open it \

3. Replace the dataset paths to yours storing location \
**‚≠êÔ∏è Important ‚≠êÔ∏è** \
üôÄ If you follow the above step to open the program file and uploads the datasets to colab, the dataset's location in program file does not need to be changed.
üôÄ Different task depends on different dataset and program. 
    1. mctest_bert_large.ipynb == MCTEST
    2. mctest_albert.ipynb == MCTEST
    3. race_distilbert.ipynb == RACE 
    4. race_albert.ipynb == RACE
    5. dream_albert.ipynb == DREAM

For the mctest dataset, please only replace the path of the file, if you are not storing the same the dataset in the same location as the original program file.
